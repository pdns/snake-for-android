# *Snake* for Android

Source code for an implementation of *Snake* for Android.
Made using the book *Beginning Android Games* (2nd Edition), written by Mario Zechner and Robert Green.

In this game, a snake (made of blocks) moves around the screen. The snake grows longer as it eats "ink stains" present around the world. The player must turn the snake left and right to eat the ink stains while avoiding a collision with the rest of its body.
